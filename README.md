# MNIST-Digits-Classification-Using-CNN

The following code repository consists of .ipynb file of MNIST Digits Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) - 

1. Dataset : It's from tensorflow.keras.datasets

2. Steps involved in the project were : 

-> Data Preprocessing (Min-Max Scaling,categorization of data)

-> Sequential model formation with 104,984 trainable parameters

-> Model Compilation with RMSprop as the Optimizer function

-> Model Training with 12 epochs and validation split of 20% (Training accuracy with 97.28% and Validation Accuracy with 98.47%)

-> Prediction Results with 98.72% of accuracy
